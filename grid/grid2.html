        <p>T1 Faker is a player for T1, a League of Legends esports organization. He has won the biggest league of legends championship 6 times on T1, and is widely recognized as the greatest League of Legends player ever. One champion he is especially known for is Azir, who is strong due to his playmaking capabilities. One of his strengths as a player is to carry games even if he's behind. Faker and T1 don't play very well during the regular season, but once they make the playoffs, they start to turn it up. Most of the wins Faker has are when he wasn't doing well at the start of the season, winning Worlds but losing regional championships.</p>
